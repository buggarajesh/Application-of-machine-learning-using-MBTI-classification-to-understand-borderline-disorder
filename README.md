Overview
This project combines machine learning (ML) techniques with the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to uncover patterns and personality types associated with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). The MBTI categorizes individuals into 16 distinct personality types based on their traits and tendencies. By analyzing MBTI responses from individuals diagnosed with BPD, ML can identify personality traits that may serve as indicators of the disorder. This approach aims to enhance our understanding of BPD, improve diagnostic accuracy, and pave the way for personalized treatment strategies tailored to the unique challenges faced by individuals with BPD.

Objectives
Identify Patterns: Use ML to analyze MBTI data and find common personality traits among individuals with BPD.
Enhance Understanding: Gain deeper insights into the potential causes and characteristics of BPD.
Improve Diagnosis: Develop more accurate diagnostic tools for BPD based on personality traits.
Personalized Treatment: Create targeted treatment plans addressing the specific needs of each person with BPD.
Contents
Data Collection: Guidelines and methods for gathering MBTI responses from individuals with and without BPD.
Data Preprocessing: Techniques for cleaning and preparing data for ML analysis.
Machine Learning Models: Implementation of various ML algorithms to analyze MBTI data and identify significant patterns.
Results and Analysis: Detailed findings and interpretations of the ML analysis.
Resources: Additional readings and references related to BPD, MBTI, and ML.
